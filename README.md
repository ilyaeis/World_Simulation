# The idea
This game is envisioned as a self-sustaining simulation of a miniature world where every aspect—from the landscape to the characters’ behaviors—is generated and governed by algorithms. The focus is on creating an organic, emergent system where interactions between the environment, characters, and villages evolve naturally, with minimal player intervention.
