# The idea
This game is envisioned as a self-sustaining simulation of a miniature world where every aspect—from the landscape to the characters’ behaviors—is generated and governed by algorithms. The focus is on creating an organic, emergent system where interactions between the environment, characters, and villages evolve naturally, with minimal player intervention.
### Expanded Plan for Game Project

#### 1. The Map: A Procedurally Generated World
The map is the foundation of your world, setting the stage for all interactions. 

##### Terrain Generation
- Noise-Based Relief: 
	  - Use Perlin Noise or Simplex Noise to generate the heightmap for the world. 
	  - Assign height ranges to biomes: 
	    - Low heights: water bodies (rivers, lakes, oceans).
	    - Mid heights: plains and forests.
	    - High heights: hills and mountains.
(Can be considered additional layers, such as climate or temperature maps, to influence biome distribution (e.g., deserts near equator-like regions, snow near poles) ).

##### Forests
- Overlay forest density using another noise function, which can:
	- Be concentrated around certain height levels or near rivers.
	- Create clusters of trees rather than uniform coverage.
- Add variation in forest types (e.g., pine forests in highlands, tropical forests near water).

##### Additional Features
- Add cliffs, caves, bridges, or unique landmarks to make the world more dynamic.
- Generate resources (e.g., minerals, herbs, game animals) that characters and villages can exploit.

#### 2. Characters 
The characters are the lifeblood of your game, bringing your world to life with their interactions and decisions.

##### Traits and Biases
- Each character will have a set of traits, each ranging from 0 to 1, such as:
	- Coward (0.7): Tendency to flee when encountering danger.
	- Rationalist (1.0): Prefers analyzing situations rather than acting impulsively.
	- Greedy (0.4): Moderate interest in accumulating resources or wealth.
	- Aggressive (0.8): High likelihood of initiating conflicts.
	-  Social (0.3): Less inclined to interact with others.
- Traits can influence:
	- Movement behavior (e.g., cautious vs. explorative).
	-  Response to threats (e.g., fight or flee).
	- Resource usage (e.g., hoarding vs. sharing).
	- Decision-making in village governance or empire-building.

##### Behavior Models
- Use decision trees or finite state machines to control behavior based on traits. For example:
	- Encountering a Predator:
	    - If coward > 0.5 → flee.
	    - If rationalist > 0.7 → analyze threat, act accordingly.
	- Resource Collection:
	    - Greedy individuals prioritize rare or valuable resources.
	    - Social individuals might share resources with allies or villagers.
- Advanced simulation: Incorporate neural networks or reinforcement learning for more nuanced, emergent behaviors.

##### Interactions
- Characters should interact with:
	- Each other: Form friendships, rivalries, or alliances.
	- Environment: Hunt animals, farm crops, cut trees, mine resources.
	- Villages: Engage in trade, disputes, or governance.


#### 3. Villages
Villages provide structure and purpose to the characters’ existence and serve as hubs for growth and empire-building.
##### Initial Placement
- Randomly scatter 10 villages across the map, ensuring:
	- Proximity to resources (e.g., near rivers, forests, or plains).
	- Adequate distance from each other for expansion.

##### Village Growth
- Villages can grow organically based on:
	- Population: Characters settle, reproduce, or migrate.
	- Resources: Villages with abundant resources grow faster.
	- Governance: Rational characters may lead villages toward efficiency, while greedy leaders may hinder progress.
- Implement a simple economy where villagers collect and trade resources, or work on projects like building walls, farms, or roads.

##### Empire Formation
- Villages may interact positively (forming alliances) or negatively (raiding or conquering).
- Introduce diplomacy mechanics:
	- Aggressive villages may demand tribute or start wars.
	- Rationalist villages may seek peace treaties or trade agreements.
- Over time, villages can merge into larger factions or empires, which could influence how characters behave (e.g., following laws, military service).

# Roadmap
1. **Prototype Phase**:
   - Generate a map with terrain, forests, and rivers.
   - Place villages and spawn simple characters with basic movement.
2. **Character Behavior**:
   - Implement a few traits and basic interactions (e.g., fleeing from threats, gathering resources).
3. **Village Mechanics**:
   - Add resource gathering, trade, and basic growth mechanics.
4. **Emergent Systems**:
   - Introduce village diplomacy and empire formation.
5. **Polishing**:
   - Add visual flair, dynamic events, and debugging for balance.
